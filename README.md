## Reverse an Array

- Write a function called ```reverseArray``` which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

### Challenge

- Be able to take an array as our input and reverse order the contents of the array as the output
- Ex. Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] -> Output: [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

### Approach & Efficiency

- Google searched methods of reversing arrays in Java and then reserve engineered the method to better understand.

## Array Shift

- Write a function called ```insertShiftArray``` which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

### Challenge Description

- Be able to take an array and value as our parameters and place the value in the middle of the input array to create a whole new array
- Ex. Input: [2, 4, 6, 8,], 5 -> Output: [2, 4, 5, 6, 8]

### Approach & Efficiency

- The first approach was to write everything down on the whiteboard to gain a better understanding of our problem domain, get a better understanding by creating a visual and using that visual to create our alogrithm for the problem.
